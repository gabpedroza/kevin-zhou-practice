# How to Use the Handouts Practice Selector

Welcome! This website helps you practice physics problems using "Spaced Repetition." It remembers which topics you find hard and makes sure you practice them more often.

## Getting Started

1.  **Open the Website:** Find the file named `index.html` in this folder and double-click it. It will open in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Safari).
2.  **Pick your problems:** On the home screen, type in how many problems you want to do (for example, 3) and click **Start Session**.
3.  **Do the work:** Click the **Open Handout** link on a card to see the problems. 
4.  **Grade yourself:** Once you finish a problem, click **Mark as Done** and choose a color:
    *   🔴 **Again:** You couldn't do it.
    *   🟡 **Hard:** You got it, but it was a big struggle.
    *   🟢 **Good:** You got it right with normal effort.
    *   🔵 **Easy:** You finished it instantly!

## Tracking Progress

*   **Points:** Every problem is worth points. You can see your total score at the bottom of the page in the **Dashboard**.
*   **Categories:** Click on the category names (like "M - Mechanics") at the bottom to see how you are doing on each specific handout.

## Saving Your Work (Advanced)

By default, your progress is only saved on your computer. If you want to keep your progress across different computers:
1. Create a "Private Repository" on GitHub.
2. Follow the instructions in the **GitHub Sync** section on the website.
3. If you don't know how to do this, don't worry! You can just use it normally on one computer.

Happy studying!
