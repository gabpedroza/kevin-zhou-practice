# How to Use the Handouts Practice Selector

Welcome! This website helps you practice physics problems using "Spaced Repetition." It remembers which topics you find hard and makes sure you practice them more often using the FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm.

## Getting Started

1.  **Open the Website:** Find the file named `index.html` in this folder and double-click it. It will open in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Safari).
2.  **Sync your data:** It is recommended to log in to **Google Drive** immediately to load your previous progress (see the "Saving Your Work" section below).
3.  **Pick your problems:** Type in how many problems you want to do (for example, 3) and click **Start Session**.
4.  **Do the work:** Click the **Open Handout** link on a card to see the problems. 
5.  **Grade yourself:** Once you finish a problem, click **Mark as Done** and choose a rating:
    *   **Again:** Total blackout, didn't know where to start.
    *   **Hard:** Solved it, but with major struggle or hints.
    *   **Good:** Standard effort, correct solution.
    *   **Easy:** Solved instantly without effort.

## Tracking Progress

*   **Points:** Every problem is worth points. You can see your total score at the bottom of the page in the **Overall Progress** dashboard.
*   **Categories:** Click on the category headers (like "M - Mechanics") at the bottom to see a detailed breakdown of your progress for each specific handout.

## Saving Your Work (Google Drive Sync)

The application now uses Google Drive to store your progress, allowing you to sync across different devices easily.

1.  **Login:** Click **Login with Google** in the "Google Drive Sync" section.
2.  **Load:** After logging in, click **Load Progress** to download your latest history from your Drive.
3.  **Save:** After finishing a session, click **Save Progress**. This will upload your current status to a file named `handouts_progress.json` in your Google Drive. 
    *   *Note: Google Drive handles versioning automatically, so you don't have to worry about losing data!*
4.  **Reset:** If you want to start over completely, use the **Reset All Progress** button (be careful, this is permanent once you save to Drive!).

Happy studying!
